        <h1>Hello This is my Home Page</h1>
        <p>
            Or Hami Sharafi, one of the most dedicated Persian 
            food ambassadors, who shares his first-hand knowledge
            of his family-operated restaurant and courses in cooking
            and hospitality in his blog “from the inside”. What 
            is common among them all is that they were born out 
            of a passion for food. Without a doubt, the world 
            is a better place now they are in it and definitely
            a more delicious one. Now packed with stunning 
            photography and detailed recipes, food blogs have 
            come a long way over the past decade or so to meet
            the exacting demands of virtual food lovers.

            You might think food blogging is an easy, free time
            hobby, but creating such informative, visual treats is
            no easy task. In fact, it is an art (most of the time, anyway),
            and, as with any serious art, it requires a lot of hard work
            and dedication. Any cook who wants to give their recipes
            a twist that stands out needs not only culinary expertise
            but also a talent for photography (an image speaks a thousand
            words, remember) and the art of a wordsmith. And that is
            only the basics. Food blogging today takes culinary 
            stories to a whole new level, covering much more than 
            delectable recipes: food travel, product placement, 
            kitchen experiments, introducing new restaurants. So 
            demanding is it that some famous food bloggers have become 
            the new connoisseurs of the culinary world, with invites to 
            critique some of the best and hottest places to eat around 
            the world.
